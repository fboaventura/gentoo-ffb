# gentoo-ffb
Gentoo Overlay repository

This is Frederico Boaventura's Gentoo local portage overlay.  I keep here ebuilds for programs not on portage tree or new versions that haven't hit the main tree yet.

I don't recommend anyone in full control of their mind to use these ebuilds. ;)

But if you are insane, like myself, just go ahead and have fun (or not...)
