Gentoo Overlay repository

This is Frederico Boaventura's Gentoo local portage overlay.  I keep here ebuilds for programs that are not on the main portage tree or new versions that haven't hit the main tree yet.  I usually open the bug at [Gentoo's Bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org), reporting the version bump or, when there are bugs already open, follow them until the update is released.

This repository is set with two branches [testing](https://github.com/fboaventura/gentoo-ffb/tree/testing), where I, well, test the ebuilds I'm working on and [master](https://github.com/fboaventura/gentoo-ffb) where I pull the validated and tested ebuilds.  They are, somehow, safe to use, since I use them myself, but I can't be held responsible for any issue you may encounter by installing these ebuilds on your machine.

Feel free to open issues to request new ebuilds, updates, removals, ... you know the drill. ;-)
